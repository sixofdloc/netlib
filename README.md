# netlib
So, what is this?  Netlib is a library for network access that targets 8-bit systems.  It is designed to be included in your asssembly-language projects.  My compiler of choice in 2006 was DASM, so the syntax is DASM-leaning, but it should be easily compiled using your assembler of choice.  This is the library Leif Bloomquist used in his famous "Netrunner" game, hats off to Lief for finding something useful to do with it :)
